I've created **2 test orders** for you to test the refund functionality:

- **Total:** $734.99
- **Items:** 3 products (Premium Earbuds, Fitness Tracker, Phone Charger)

### **Step 2: Test "Confirm Received" Flow**

2. **Click "Confirm Received"** button
3. **Verify:**
   - Order status changes to `completed`
   - Delivery status changes to `confirmed_received`
   - Customer response timestamp is recorded
   - Order disappears from "waiting for response" list

### **Step 3: Test "Request Return" Flow**
1. **Reset the order** (if needed) or create a new one
2. **Click "Request Return"** button
3. **Fill out the return form:**
   - Enter a reason (e.g., "Product arrived damaged")
   - Submit the form
4. **Verify:**
   - Order status remains `delivered`
   - Delivery status changes to `return_requested`
   - Return status changes to `requested`
   - Return reason is saved
   - Return timestamp is recorded

### **Step 4: Test Auto-Confirmation**
1. **Create a test order** with deadline in the past

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If orders don't appear in waiting list:**
1. Check if user is logged in as `test@example.com`
2. Verify order status is `delivered`
3. Check if response deadline is in the future
4. Check Laravel logs for errors

### **If buttons don't work:**
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify CSRF token is present
3. Check if user is authenticated
4. Check Laravel logs for request errors

### **If order status doesn't change:**
1. Check Laravel logs for errors
2. Verify database connection
3. Check if Order model methods are working
4. Verify form submission is reaching the controller
